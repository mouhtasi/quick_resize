	Python Image Library (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)

This script quickly resizes a single or multiple images which are dragged and dropped onto the .py/.pyw file. The default options are my preferences for resizing large scans into smaller cover images.

The maximum dimensions are specified by max_width and max_height, keeping the original aspect ratio. The image is resized using the best quality anti-aliasing and saved with 85% jpeg quality [can be changed in "img.save(newpath, quality=85)"]. 
To drag and drop without having the console pop up, rename the script extension to .pyw.

Drag and dropping onto Python files works by default in Python 2.6 and later. For previous versions of Python, refer to http://bugs.python.org/issue1656675
